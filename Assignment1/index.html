                <h1>Week2</h1>
                <h2>1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</h2>
                <p>I will first look at the home page of this website, and then click on the author's introduction page 
                    to understand what the author does, and then click on the portfolio page to learn more about this 
                    page. You can see that the author explains the code very clearly.
                </p>
                <h2>2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting 
                    with the experience?</h2>
                <p>My first concern is the typography of this 
                    page, because the typography can clearly 
                    tell that this page is about portfolio</p>
                <h2>3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
                <p>I spend the most time browsing the 
                    author's portfolio, there's a lot of info 
                    on the code the author makes</p>
                <h2>4) What was the most common action in your two minute 
                    interaction with the experience?</h2>
                <p>My most common action is to click the 
                    mouse. On the portfolio interface, I need 
                    to click the icon to display the relevant 
                    content.</p>
                <h2>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the 
                    interactive experience?</h2>
                <p>
                    My expectation for the interactive experience is that the web interface layout needs to be clear, 
                    let users know what the website is about, and be able to use the website quickly and easily.
                </p>
                <h2>6) How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h2>
                <p>
                    My experience with this goal is that on the homepage of the portfolio 
                    the author clearly describes the various functions of the page, 
                    and I can quickly browse the information I want to know.
                </p>
                <h2>7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single 
                    interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the 
                    experience?</h2>
                <p>My expectation was that I might be able to browse this page in two minutes, 
                    and while I can't look closely at the page that introduces the code, 
                    I can understand that this is a personal information page about the author explaining the code. 
                    If I need to better understand the author and have the idea of ​​​​learning the code from the author,
                    it will take a long process to browse the website, 
                    because in the interface of the portfolio, 
                    the author is divided into multiple parts to introduce, 
                    and it takes a certain amount of time to browse this interface.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item" id="week3">
                <h1>Week3</h1>
                <h2>8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental 
                    model reference?</h2>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, this website is a metaphor for a diary, 
                    in which I write my own experiences and what I want to do and like.
                </p>
                <h2>9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel 
                    and/or act when engaging with it?</h2>
                <p>It is convenient for me to quickly browse the arrangement of the website and understand the general information of the website.</p>
                <h2>10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what 
                    makes it frustrating to you?</h2>
                <p>In the Portfolio interface, the author is divided into various squares, 
                    which seems too dense and boring, which cannot arouse my interest to browse each information.</p>
                <h2>11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what 
                    makes it satisfying to you?</h2>
                <p>
                    The interaction design of the main page surprised me. 
                    Although it looks a bit simple, it can clearly show me every information module of this page, 
                    and when I click the information bar, there will be a dynamic effect. This is Interesting point.</p>
